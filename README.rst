ParticleDensityDouble
=====================

ParticleDensityDouble is a software tool for analysis of immunogold labeled
electron micrographs. Specifically, it is used to analyse double gold 
labeling (in the form of two types of differently sized gold particles) in 
closed compartments. It is of course also possible to use the tool for other
types of two-dimensional spatial point patterns.

ParticleDensityDouble is used in conjunction with its companion ImageJ plugin,
ParticleDensityDouble.IJ.
