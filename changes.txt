2018-05-30:
- Now works with Python 3 instead of Python 2.
- Particles outside the simulation window can now be chosen to be excluded for
  interpoint distance calculations when using Monte Carlo simulations with
  simulation window other than 'Profile + shell' and provided simulated
  interpoint distances are also calculated. This allows for better comparison
  between interparticle distances and simulated interpoint distances.
- Processed coordinates, including adjusted PSDs and Monte Carlo simulated
  points, can now be saved to new output files for each profile.
- Removed option to choose which summary files to save.
- Adjusted the list of possible combinations of point types for which interpoint
  distances can be calculated.
- Uses openpyxl instead of pyExcelerator, and generates .xlsx files instead of
  old-format .xls files.
- Renamed some class names for succinctness: ProfileBorderData to ProfileBorder,
  ClusterData to Cluster, ProfileData to Profile.
- Changed icon.
- Other minor changes.
2015-04-15:
- Bug fixes.
2015-01-14:
- Fixed Monte Carlo simulations that had been broken in a previous version.
- Monte Carlo simulation windows should now work as expected.
- Removed the strict localization option when using simulation window "profile +
  shell".
- Most functions in class ProfileData are now semiprivate.
- A rather comprehensive code cleanup.
- Various other small changes and bug fixes.
2014-11-11:
- Code cleanup.
- Various other small changes and bug fixes.
- License changed to the MIT license.
2014-05-14:
- Modified the user interface of the Python component; it should now work
  properly also on platforms other than Windows.
- Processing in the Python component is now cancellable through a progress
  dialog.
- Now saves current input directory to a config file named
  '.particledensitydouble.cfg' in the user's home directory.
- Current options can also be saved to '.particledensitydouble.cfg'. Options
  specified in that file will be loaded when the program is started.
- New icon.
- PyExcelerator is again included in the Window binaries.
- Other small bug fixes and changes.
2014-04-23:
- Adjusted some elements in the user interface so they are not partly
  hidden when using newer versions of wxPython.
- Added link to new web site in the About dialog.
2013-11-13:
- Fixed a bug that broke the parsing of files lacking random points (the
  program complained that it expected random points).
- Now recognizes PROFILE_TYPE in input files, and adds a column with profile
  type in certain output files.
- Previously, options were not reset between sequential runs. Thus for example,
  if processing one set of files containing random points and then another set
  of files lacking such points, the latter would lead to an error that random
  points were expected but not found. This has now been fixed.
2011-02-02:
- Now recognizes "RANDOM_POINTS" as a synonym for "RANDOM" in input files, to
  accommodate for the random points generated by add_random.py.
- Temporarily set opt.useRandom to True because the check to see whether
  random points should be used is dysfunctional.
